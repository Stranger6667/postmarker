    [<Bounce: 943247350>, <Bounce: 924829573>]

Default number of bounces, which will be returned is 500 to fit in single network request.
More than 500 items will be fetching in multiple network requests:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> postmark.bounces.all(count=1001)
    [<Bounce: 943247350>, <Bounce: 924829573>, ...]

Here it will be 3 network requests, single one is limited by 500 items.
To load all available data, pass `None` as `count` value.

Every bounce instance is represented by its ID. You can search be specifying the ID.

.. code-block:: python
